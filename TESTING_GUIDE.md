# IMMEDIATE TESTING GUIDE

## Quick Fix for Current Issue

The Stripe API error you're seeing is because your `.env` file has placeholder API keys. Here's how to test the application immediately:

### Option 1: Use Development Bypass Mode (Recommended for Testing)

Your `.env` file has been updated with bypass flags:

```env
BYPASS_STRIPE=true
BYPASS_OPENAI=true
```

This allows you to test all functionality without real API keys:
- ✅ Subscriptions will be automatically activated (no payment required)
- ✅ Chat will respond with mock messages
- ✅ Voice transcription will return mock text
- ✅ All other features work normally

### Option 2: Get Real Stripe Keys

If you want to test with real payments:

1. **Create Stripe Account**: Go to https://stripe.com and sign up
2. **Get Test Keys**: In Stripe Dashboard → Developers → API keys
3. **Update .env**: Replace the placeholder values with your real test keys

## Testing Steps

1. **Restart the application**:
   ```powershell
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   py run.py
   ```

2. **Check status page**: Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/status`
   - Should show "Bypass Mode Active" for Stripe and OpenAI

3. **Test user flow**:
   - Register a new user
   - Choose a subscription plan (will activate immediately in bypass mode)
   - Upload Excel files
   - Test chat functionality (will get mock responses)

## Expected Behavior in Bypass Mode

### Subscription:
- Selecting any plan will immediately activate the subscription
- No payment processing occurs
- User gets full access to features

### Chat/AI:
- Chat messages get mock responses indicating development mode
- Voice recordings get mock transcriptions
- All responses are in the selected language

### All Other Features:
- File uploads work normally
- User management works normally
- Admin panel works normally
- Language switching works normally

## Switching to Production

When ready for real payments and AI:

1. Get real API keys from Stripe and OpenAI
2. Update `.env` file with real keys
3. Set bypass flags to false:
   ```env
   BYPASS_STRIPE=false
   BYPASS_OPENAI=false
   ```
4. Restart the application

## Current Status

✅ **Application is fully functional**  
✅ **All features can be tested**  
✅ **No API keys needed for testing**  
✅ **Ready for development and demonstration**  

The error you saw was just the application trying to use placeholder Stripe keys. With bypass mode enabled, this won't happen anymore.
